# Learning Notes â€” R Markdown Source Files

Welcome to the Learning Notes repository! This project contains the R Markdown source code used to generate the interactive HTML pages featured in my portfolio. These notes cover statistical concepts, examples, and visualizations, created to support both my learning journey and to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and reproducible research.

## Repository Contents

- .Rmd files: R Markdown documents combining explanatory text, R code, and plots.
- Output HTML files: Generated interactive documents (optional or in a separate branch/folder).
- Supporting scripts or data (if any): Any additional R scripts, datasets, or resources used in the notes.

## Purpose

The Learning Notes section showcases my ability to:

- Write clear, well-documented technical content.
- Integrate statistical theory with practical R examples.
- Create reproducible and dynamic reports using R Markdown.
- Visualize data through code-generated plots to aid understanding.

## How to Use

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-notes.git
Open any .Rmd file in RStudio.
Knit the document to HTML or PDF to generate the final report with text, code, and visualizations.

## Technologies

- R
- R Markdown
- ggplot2 for plotting
- Other tidyverse packages as needed
